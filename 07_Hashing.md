### Introduction to Hashing

- Hashing allows **Search, Insert, and Delete in O(1) time on average**.
- It maps **large values to small keys** using a **hash function**.
- Hashing is used in data structures like **hash tables, sets, and maps**.

### Direct Address Table (Perfect Hashing)

- Works when the key range is **small and known in advance**.
- Example: If **x is in the range [0, 999]**, we can use a direct address table with an array of size 1000.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert:** Set `hash[x] = 1` to mark presence.
  - **Delete:** Set `hash[x] = 0` to remove the element.
  - **Search:** Simply return `hash[x]`, which is either 0 (absent) or 1 (present).

⚡ **Drawback:** Requires **O(N) space**, even if only a few keys are used.

### Hash Function

- Converts a **large input value** into a **smaller key** in the range `[0, m-1]`.
- A common technique is **Modulo-based Hashing**, where `x % m` is used to determine the hash index, with `m` being a prime number.
- **Desirable properties of a good hash function**:
   - **Fast computation** to maintain efficiency.
   - **Uniform distribution** to minimize collisions.
   - **Deterministic** so that the same input always maps to the same output.

### Collision Handling

Since multiple inputs can map to the **same key**, we need to handle **collisions**:

1. **Chaining (Separate Chaining)**
   - Each hash table index stores a **linked list or vector**.
   - When a collision occurs, we **append** the new element to the list.
   - **Insertion, Search, and Delete take O(1) on average**, assuming a good hash function.

2. **Open Addressing**
   - If a collision occurs, search for an empty slot within the table.
   - Common methods:
     - **Linear Probing:** Check the next available slot, moving sequentially.
     - **Quadratic Probing:** Check slots farther away, using a squared step size (1², 2², 3², ...).
     - **Double Hashing:** Use a second hash function to determine the step size, reducing clustering.
