### C Style String

- `char s1[] = "hello";`
  - This initializes a **C-style string** using a character array. It automatically appends a **null terminator (`\0`)** at the end to mark the end of the string.
  
- `char s1[] = {'h','e','l','l','o'}; // Necessary \0`
  - This is an alternative way to initialize a C-style string, manually specifying each character. However, the null terminator (`\0`) is necessary at the end of the string to denote the stringâ€™s end.

### C++ String

- `string str = "hello";`
  - This initializes a **C++ string** using the `string` class, which is more flexible than C-style strings. It handles memory management and includes many built-in functions for string manipulation.

- **Comparison Operators**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, etc.
  - These operators can be used to compare strings lexicographically (i.e., based on their alphabetical order).

- `str.substr()`
  - This function is used to extract a **substring** from a string, starting from a specified index.

- `str.find()`
  - This function finds the first occurrence of a substring or character in the string and returns its index.
