### Basic Deque Operations
- **insertFront(x)** – Inserts an element at the front of the deque  
- **deleteFront()** – Removes the front element  
- **getFront()** – Retrieves the front element without removing it  
- **insertRear(x)** – Inserts an element at the rear  
- **deleteRear()** – Removes the rear element  
- **getRear()** – Retrieves the rear element without removing it  
- **size()** – Returns the number of elements in the deque  
- **isEmpty()** – Checks whether the deque is empty  

### Deque Implementations
- **Deque using Arrays**: Fixed-size array with front and rear index management.  
- **Deque using Linked List**: Doubly linked list enabling efficient front and rear operations.  
- **Deque using STL**: Built-in `deque` container offering optimized double-ended access.
